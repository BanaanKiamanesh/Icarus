# **Project: Icarus**

The project, named "Icarus" after the Greek mythologies, comprises three distinct phases. 

1. Dynamical Modelling and Implementation of a Linear PID Controller on a 6 DoF Quadcopter
2. A Simple Learning Strategy for QuadCopter MultiFlips in the second phase
3. Design and Implementation of a non-linear Robust Sliding Mode Controller on a 6 DoF quadcopter

All the simulations were conducted using MATLAB 2023a Software, and each algorithm used was implemented from scratch.

A comprehensive report is prepared to be as informative as possible. It is beneficial for those working with aerial vehicles, particularly quadcopters. Make sure to check it out in the "Report" directory.
